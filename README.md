# WordPress Boilerplate Template
## Using gasoline.css

### Setup

1. Download the latest version of WordPress [from here](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/download/) and copy all the files (aside from `wp-content`)
2. Setup a local development in MAMP (or your environment of choice) - create and update `wp-config.php` with these new details
3. Open Terminal and change directory to the themes assets folder (default: `wp-content/themes/gasoline/assets`)
4. Run `npm i`
5. Now you can rename the theme to whatever you want and also update the themes `functions.php` with this new naming structure
6. Click `Watch Sass` in VS Code to compile the CSS - this is done via the [Live Sass Compiler plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass)
